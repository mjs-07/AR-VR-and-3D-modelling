# AR-VR-and-3D-modelling
This is the project by first year student for AR/VR and 3D modelling club, SASTRA University, Thanjavur

This is a model of "bow and arrow". 
Though it seems easy, it is the most powerful weapon in the ancient period. Myth states that an arrow as every power to create fire, water and any medium of destruction
I have added an axe and arrow head to it such that it becomes easier for shorter distance attacks too .....
